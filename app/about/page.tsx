                <p>
                  My journey in technology began during my childhood when I discovered the magic
                  of creating something from nothing through code. What started as curiosity about
                  how computers work evolved into a deep passion for building solutions that matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout my academic journey at Stanford and MIT, I focused on artificial
                  intelligence and distributed systems, always with an eye toward practical
                  applications. My thesis work on real-time data processing laid the foundation
                  for much of my professional work today.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an entrepreneur, I've founded multiple ventures, including BlazeBuster, a
                  startup focused on wildfire prevention using IoT and ML technologies. I believe
                  in using technology not just for profit, but for purpose â€“ to address climate
                  change, improve accessibility, and create opportunities for others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding or building businesses, you'll find me rock climbing,
                  exploring new places with my camera, or mentoring the next generation of
                  engineers. I'm always excited to connect with like-minded individuals who
                  share a passion for innovation and positive impact.
